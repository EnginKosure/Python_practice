# Each player takes the maximal value of his three results.
# The player with the larger number wins.

# INPUT: an integer number n>=0

# OUTPUT: two integers a and b,
# the numerator and denominator of the probability written as a/b
# (with the smallest possible b) that you will win the game with your three attempts
