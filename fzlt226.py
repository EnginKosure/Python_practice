On the First day of Christmas
My true love sent to me
A partridge in a pear tree.

On the Second day of Christmas
My true love sent to me
Two turtle doves, and
A partridge in a pear tree.

...

On the Twelfth day of Christmas
My true love sent to me
Twelve drummers drumming,
Eleven pipers piping,
Ten lords a-leaping,
Nine ladies dancing,
Eight maids a-milking,
Seven swans a-swimming,
Six geese a-laying,
Five gold rings,
Four calling birds,
Three French hens,
Two turtle doves, and
A partridge in a pear tree.
