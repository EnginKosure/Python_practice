# A prison can be represented as a list of cells. Each cell contains exactly one prisoner.
# A 1 represents an unlocked cell and a 0 represents a locked cell.

# [1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0]
# Starting inside the leftmost cell, you are tasked with seeing
# how many prisoners you can set free, with a catch. You are the prisoner in the first cell.
# If the first cell is locked, you cannot free anyone. Each time you free a prisoner,
# the locked cells become unlocked, and the unlocked cells become locked again.
